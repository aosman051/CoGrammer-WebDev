            <p> Hello, My name is Alafiya and I'm learning to become a web developer.
                This is a new and exciting oppotunity for me to gain experience in a completely new field
                that I had never before considered. As I grow and develop my skills, this page will be updated to reflect that
                learning and I hope you will all follow me in my journey!
